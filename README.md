## Additional Notes
* The sessions(logged in/logged out state) are handled through utilizing cookies. There is an update in web browsers that blocks cross-origin cookie requests if the connection is not secure. Since E-mbakan is hosted in the localhost and by nature is not secure as it uses HTTP, Chrome refuses to honor the cookie request and the login session does not work correctly. However, it works in Firefox as it has not yet deprecated or blocks that behavior.
